# Welcome to my user u06 project!

In this assignment, I chose to fetch my u05 API and create a frontend design for it.

## ðŸš€ How it works

It's very simple to use:

1. Create a user  
2. Log in  
3. Add income, expenses, and saving goals  
4. Start managing your finances!

As a user, you will also be able to edit your profile or delete it if you wish.

##  Note

This project is still in progress, which means it is not fully completed yet.
